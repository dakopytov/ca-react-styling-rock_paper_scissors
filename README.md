## General info
In this project, I will get the chance to practice styling React applications using different techniques.
I will be styling a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. However, rather than sticking to one technique, I will be asked to modify its appearance using inline styling syntax, object variable syntax, and, finally, CSS modules!
Throughout the project, Iâ€™ll be able to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and practice React naming conventions for style properties.
By the end of this practice project, I will have improved your skills in styling React applications using various techniques and gained a deeper understanding of the different approaches. I will be able to apply your learnings to future React projects and improve your coding skills!
